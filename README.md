# SQL_Project_When_Was_the_Golden_Age_of_Video_Games
**Data Manipulation - joining datasets, filter, group, and order data**

## Project Description
In this project, I analyzed video game critic and user scores, as well as sales data, for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I searched for a "golden age" of video games by identifying release years that received high ratings from both users and critics. Additionally, I explored the business side of gaming by examining game sales data. To accomplish these tasks, I joined datasets, filtered, grouped, and ordered data. Furthermore, I created tables from CSV files and dataframes using the results of SQL queries.
