# SQL_Project_When_Was_the_Golden_Age_of_Video_Games
**Data Manipulation - joining datasets, filter, group, and order data**

## Project Description
In this project, I analyzed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. 
I searched for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and I explored the business side of gaming by looking 
at game sales data. I did this by joining datasets, filter, group and order data, I also created tables from CSV files and dataframes using the results of SQL queries.
